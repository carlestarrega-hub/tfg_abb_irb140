[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:36 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findabb_librws.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "abb_librws", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "abb_librws" with
  any of the following names:

    abb_librwsConfig.cmake
    abb_librws-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "abb_librws" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "abb_librws_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "abb_librws" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
