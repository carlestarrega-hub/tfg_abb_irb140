[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:33 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findabb_egm_rws_managers.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "abb_egm_rws_managers", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by
  "abb_egm_rws_managers" with any of the following names:

    abb_egm_rws_managersConfig.cmake
    abb_egm_rws_managers-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "abb_egm_rws_managers" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
  or set "abb_egm_rws_managers_DIR" to a directory containing one of the
  above files.  If "abb_egm_rws_managers" provides a separate development
  package or SDK, be sure it has been installed.
